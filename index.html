            <h1 id="biography-title"> Biography </h1>
            <p> On September 28, 1823, in Montpellier, France, Alexandre Cabanel was born. Before becoming the representative of neoclassicism, at age 17, he studied at the Ã‰cole des Beaux-Arts school in Paris. At the age of 22, he had his first exhibition in Paris, winning the Prix de Rome. As a painter of great prominence, it did not take long for him to become a teacher at the school he studied in, in 1863. He often appeared at the Salon, from which he acquired a second-class medal (1852). He was also awarded a First (1855) and Medal of Honor (1865 and 1863).
                Laying great landmark paintings behind him, he died, in Paris, at the age of 65, in the year 1883. The cause of death is unknown. </p>

                <h1> Impactful arts </h1>
                <p> Religious paintings usually depicted <span> angels </span> or <span> heroic figures </span>, but never of Lucifer. As a result, the painting called <span> Fallen Angel </span> appeared, made in 1847 by Alexandre Cabanel, <span> the first painter to portray Lucifer </span>, and as a consequence, the reaction of jurists when they saw such a painting was one of astonishment and rebuke. Not only this one, but many paintings painted by him were seen as controversial, and idem, beautiful, in the eyes of those who glimpsed them.
                    By many, he was considered a great painter, and very daring, when it came to religious and mythological paintings. His beautiful painting caught the eyes of <span> Napoleon III </span>, who asked him to paint important works in the imperial palaces. </p>
